Swathi, I joined QTB meeting today and JOE brought an issue on POST order response not same as PRE order response.

Issues listed:
	1. Pre is working but POST is going to ORW path
	2. Check customer table if the order is delayed
	3. Issue : Apo is not sent in post order
	4. Pre order sends APO
	5. Missing account level SPO's in POST order


I am still working on this.. He gave me the  xml's


I am ot able to proceed much on Joe's issue..
I tried looking into the tables to see any db timestamp difference when the post order is executed and order is placed
